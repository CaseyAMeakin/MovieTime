# MovieTime

This is a demonstration web application for browsing movies and finding viewing advice. Viewing suggestions are based on a collaborative filtering algorithm which taps into the large number of movie critic reviews online and cross references those with website user viewing preferences. User preferences are based on an online polling interface which allows users to provide feedback on Movies, Directors, Writers, and Actors. 

The website was built using Django, Bootstrap, and MySQL.
